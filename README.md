# BOA Comedy Show 

Boa Comedy Show is a python survey input that collects sales numbers from the user, calculate unsold tickets and recommend sales numbers for each caetgory of tickets for their future event.

## Introduction
The show is an annual comedy show that sells different categories of tickets for their event.

<p>For each event the organizers pre-sell tickets, if they sell out of a particular category, the organizers print more tickets to sell while the unsold ones are thrashed after the event.</p>

## Our main goal
Our goal is to save the company some time by automating a repetitive task and help reduce the unsold tickets by better predicting ticket sales for future events.
